# Java, JPS and servlets for a blog
The files contained in this repository are all the .java and .jsp files that I was responsible for during a development project.
The project involved creating a blog. 


Java servlets:

- UserHome.java (a servlet used specifically for any user deletion, updates or creation. 
- ArticleCreation.java (a servlet that handles the posting of an article to the blog)
- ArticleAlter.java (a servlet that handles article editing) 
- User.java, Article.java, ArticleDAO.java and UserDAO.java are the database handlers for users and articles

Web Pages/UI:

- I was responsible for the majority of .html and .jsp pages in here
- I also wrote the two NavBars (depending on whether the user is logged in or not) under 'WEB-INF'
